# Tinchi

from sicilian: _TÃ¬nci_ (ph: tin-chee) = To Paint.

A small set of css utils classes to quickly startup your css project without having to copy paste snippets all over the place.

Kind of like a small lightweight and ugly tailwind, but less config heavy.

## How to use it
```
npm i -g tinchi
```

or/then

```
npx tinchi i
```
To init the config file on your project folder.

The `.tinchirc` file generated will look like this:
```
{
  "output": "public/assets/style.css",
  "vars": {
    "DARK": "#000003",
    "LIGHT": "#fbfcfe",
    "DARK_FAINT": "#2e2e2e",
    "LIGHT_FAINT": "#e8e9eb",
```
Here you can edit colours and output, to specify where to dump the output style file.

Then you can:

```
tinchi generate
```
This will generate the style file ready to be used in your project.

If you then use it in your html file, or in your js bundler you are ready to go.

More info with
```
npx tinchi help
```

```
